# Defect 4 Fix Start: Two problems corrected here.
# (1) Attempt counts were inverted: Easy=6, Normal=8, Hard=5 made Normal easier
#     than Easy. Confirmed the expected ordering with AI and corrected the values.
# (2) get_range_for_difficulty returned 1–20 for Easy and 1–50 for Hard, so the
#     secret number and range validation were tighter on those tiers while the UI
#     still showed "1 to 100". This caused a mismatch where a secret above 20
#     could be generated on Easy but the player could not guess above 20.
#     Removed per-difficulty ranges; all tiers now share 1–100 uniformly.
#     Difficulty is expressed solely through attempt count.

# st.info() renders before the submit block increments the value.
# We traced both causes by reading session_state in the debug panel and asking
# AI to walk through Streamlit's top-to-bottom execution model. AI showed that
# on the run triggered by a button click, the counter line executes before the
# increment line — so the display always reflects the previous run's value.
# Fix: initialize to 0 and use st.empty() placeholder filled after the submit
# block so the counter always reflects the post-increment value.

# st.form_submit_button as the correct pattern. Wrapping the input and submit
# button inside st.form ties Enter key presses to form submission automatically.

    # so that invalid input (bad format or out-of-range) is treated as a free
    # re-entry and does not cost the player an attempt. Discussed with AI —
    # penalizing a typo is poor UX, especially on Hard with only 4 attempts.

        # randomly for the same guess. We spotted the toggle by re-submitting
        # the same number twice and watching the hint change. AI explained why
